\section{Proposed method}
In order to show comprehensive aspects of H1-B statistics to the potential users, we propose a method of 
heterogeneous visualization method employing multiply widely used charts implemented by popular Vue and Flask.

Users will select the h1-b information which they are interested in on our portal page. Their request will be 
passed to our backend REST API that was implemented by Python Flask. The API will then send the corresponding 
statistics back to the front-end interface. The UI will then process the data and render the chart on the newly-directed 
page. And the user can view the chart and use the mouse to interact with the chart. The front-end application 
based on Vue and D3 is expected to be totally interactive so as to provide the user rich choices of viewing, 
comparing, selecting and even searching by certain fields.

There must be some arguments that this could all be done by h1bgrader.com. However, we are introducing three main 
innovations. To begin with, our system will provide users more selections and interaction of the chart types. At least 
cases by state choropleth chart has never been implemented by that known webstie. Besides, we would offer more 
significant information like search by section and search by state that the users must have to visit other websites for. Last but not 
least, our project introduced the machine learning method to predict the visa statistical trend which these kind of 
websites never provide.

All the h1-b case data was retrieved from DOL official website, which makes our source authoritative and trustworthy. 
However, the naming rubric change still happened through these years. Therefore, OpenRefine is used to conformalize the data 
extracting the columns the project actually needs.

The cost of the development is terrifically economic. All of our data and framework are free, and we will be hosting the system 
on any local business machine.

\section{Timelines}
\subsection{Current timeline}

\begin{itemize}
	\item November 13: Database, backend, and frontend connected and communicating
	\item November 20: Application functioning on small dataset
	\item November 24: Poster design complete
	\item November 27: Application polished and presentable for poster presentations
	\item November 30: Poster presentation, full dataset uploaded
	\item December 4: Final report complete
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Previous timeline}
\begin{itemize}
	\item October 23: Able to query locations from front-end, all data added to database
	\item November 6: Simple path generated and displayed based on user-provided start and end points
	\item November 10: Progress report due
	\item November 20: User can select options to impact path generation, continue to refine algorithm and front-end
	\item November 28: Poster presentation
	\item December 5: Project complete, final report due
\end{itemize}

\section{Work distribution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scraping and collecting data, geocaching (Alex)
	\item Cleaning and standardizing data (Chuanqi)
	\item Designing our algorithm (Qinrui)
	\item Implementing the backend (Tianshu)
	\item Creating the front-end (Tianyu)
\end{itemize}

All team members have contributed similar amount of effort.

\section{Innovations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Incorporating trail quality data
	\item Using Tarjan's algorithm to generate paths
	\item Scraping and providing points of interest specifically geared towards bikers and hikers
\end{itemize}

Further possible innovations we would like to implement if we have time:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hikers can update trails and give feedback
	\item One can edit the trail he wants to follow directly in the interface (by drag and drop for example)
	\item One can export the trail to a gps thanks to a gpx file
\end{itemize}
