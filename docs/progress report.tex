\section{Timelines}
\subsection{Current timeline}

\begin{itemize}
	\item November 13: Database, backend, and frontend connected and communicating
	\item November 20: Application functioning on small dataset
	\item November 24: Poster design complete
	\item November 27: Application polished and presentable for poster presentations
	\item November 30: Poster presentation, full dataset uploaded
	\item December 4: Final report complete
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Previous timeline}
\begin{itemize}
	\item October 23: Able to query locations from front-end, all data added to database
	\item November 6: Simple path generated and displayed based on user-provided start and end points
	\item November 10: Progress report due
	\item November 20: User can select options to impact path generation, continue to refine algorithm and front-end
	\item November 28: Poster presentation
	\item December 5: Project complete, final report due
\end{itemize}

\section{Work distribution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scraping and collecting data, geocaching (Alex)
	\item Cleaning and standardizing data (Chuanqi)
	\item Designing our algorithm (Qinrui)
	\item Implementing the backend (Tianshu)
	\item Creating the front-end (Tianyu)
\end{itemize}

All team members have contributed similar amount of effort.

\section{Innovations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Incorporating trail quality data
	\item Using Tarjan's algorithm to generate paths
	\item Scraping and providing points of interest specifically geared towards bikers and hikers
\end{itemize}

Further possible innovations we would like to implement if we have time:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hikers can update trails and give feedback
	\item One can edit the trail he wants to follow directly in the interface (by drag and drop for example)
	\item One can export the trail to a gps thanks to a gpx file
\end{itemize}
